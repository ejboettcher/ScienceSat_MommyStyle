# Build a cloud chamber

## Objective
Build a cloud chamber and visualize the path of charged particles.

An atmosphere of isopropyl alcohol vapor will condense into drops forming a track when 
a charged particle travels through. 

## Materials

- [ ] Aquarium
- [ ] Dry ice
- [ ] isopropyl alcohol
- [ ] Felt
- [ ] heat source (warm water) 
- [ ] Light source

- [ ] (optional) camera, video recorder to record tracks

## Concept

Warm isopropyl alcohol at the top of the chamber will evaporate. The bottom of the
chamber is cooled with dry ice, cooling the evaporated alcohol which diffuses downward.
Near the bottom of the chamber, the alcohol vapor becomes supersaturated and will 
condense when disturbed by charged radioactive particles traveling through the chamber.

## Prep 

Stick the felt to the bottom of the aquarium.

## Attempts

None
