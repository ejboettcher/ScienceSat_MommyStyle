# Super cooled water
## Objective
Show a phase change in real time.
It's like magic, but not really since it is real science.

The goal is to supercool the water and cause it to rapidly freeze

## Prep Time
LONG.  You need to carefully cool the water for about 2.25 hours.
## Attempts
First try failed.
	* Going to try thicker water bottle.
   The ones I used were really thin.
   
   * You must also hold the cool the water without shaking or otherwise
   disturbing it. If it's disturbed it may freeze instead of supercool.
