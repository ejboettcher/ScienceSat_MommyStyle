## Science Saturday with a Mom.

Backyard science with common household equipment.
Goal is to show that science is:

- [ ] Interesting
- [ ] Does not need expensive equipment
- [ ] Something you can do at home
- [ ] A kid (at heart too) can do alone
    * Adult supervision RECOMMENDED
- [ ] Emphasize that science is all around us and not just something that happens in a lab.  
    * One way to do that, is to use everyday objects to do science.
- [ ] Doable in less than an hour

## Optics / Light Lessons:
* [Laser Jello](./lessons/LaserJello.md)


## Chemistry Lessons:
* [Water Electrolysis](./lessons/WaterElectrolysis.md): Separate H2 of the O using Legos and a battery.
* [Coin Battery](./lessons/CoinBattery.md): Build a battery with spare change
* [Sodium](./lessons/Sodium.md)  
* [Soap Foam](./lessons/SoapFoam.md) aka Elephant Toothpaste or Unicorn Poo
* **Solubility**:
    * [Solubility](./lessons/Materialsinwater.md): Identifying which material make a solution or mixture in water.
    * [Gas Solubility](./lessons/Co2Solubity.md): CO2 Solubility in Water as function of Temperature
    * [Solid Solubility](./lessons/SugarSolubilty.md): Sugar Solubility in Water as function of Temperature
* [Diffusion](./lessons/Dyecolor.md): Using Food coloring and hot/cold water to show thermal energy as diffusion.


## Physics Lessons:
* [Super Cooled Water](./lessons/CoolWater.md)(soon)
* [Plasma with Grapes](./lessons/PlasmaGrape.md): Make a Plasma using fruit and a microwave
* **Density**
    * [Aluminum Boats: Make metal float](./lessons/AluminumBoats.md)   
    * [Sink A Marshmallow](./lessons/SinkAMarshmallow.md)
    * [Pennies and Water](./lessons/Water_density_temp.md): Measure with pennies the differences of water density as function of temperature
* [Spectroscope](./lessons/spectroscope.md): Make a spectroscope with a defraction grating and "See" what colors are in light.
* [Diffusion](./lessons/Dyecolor.md): Using Food coloring and hot/cold water to show thermal energy as diffusion.  See how thermal energy causes the water molecule to "move" more causing the dye to diffuse faster.

## Electronics Lessons:
* [Coin Battery](./lessons/CoinBattery.md)

## Food science

* [Make Dry Ice, Ice Cream](./lessons/IceCream.md): Tasty Emulsions!
* Butter (soon)
* Sugar Candy (soon)

## Math
* [Conics with wax paper](./lessons/Conics.md) 

## One Hour Fun:
### Chemistry 101
Shows how elements have different physical properties than a molecule made up of those elements.  Then explore how the ratio effect the physical properties of the molecule with H2O and H2O2.
* [Water Electrolysis](./lessons/WaterElectrolysis.md)
* [Soap Foam](./lessons/SoapFoam.md) (Very Messy but fun.)

### Solubility
This has two parts (total of four lessons).  It covers solubility vs. mixtures and how thermal energy (which can causes increased diffusion) affects the solubility of a material in water.

#### Part I:
See how different material disperse into water to make a solution or mixture.  Also see how thermal energy affects how the material disperses.
* [Solubility](./lessons/Materialsinwater.md): Identifying which material make a solution or mixture in water.
* [Diffusion](./lessons/Dyecolor.md): Using Food coloring and hot/cold water to show thermal energy as diffusion.

#### Part II:
Water Solubility of solids and gasses as a function of temperature.
These two experiments should go hand in hand.  As temperature increases gasses want to dissolve **OUT OF** of water; however solids want to dissolve **INTO** the water.  

* [Gas Solubility](./lessons/Co2Solubity.md): CO2 Solubility in Water as function of Temperature
* [Solid Solubility](./lessons/SugarSolubilty.md): Sugar Solubility in Water as function of Temperature


### Density 101
* [Aluminum Boats: Volume](./lessons/AlBoats.md): Make a metal float!
* [Sink A Marshmallow](./lessons/SinkAMarshmallow.md):
* [Pennies and Water](./lessons/Water_density_temp.md): Measure with pennies the differences of water density as function of temperature

### Stars: Why we look out
We look out to discover more about ourselves and our planet.  
By looking out into the stars we learned how plasma work and discovered
helium 30 years before it was found on earth using a spectroscope.

* [Spectroscope: Measure light](./lessons/spectroscope.md)

## Watch on YouTube ONLY
There are cool experiments out there that one should not do at home but they are still pretty cool.  Below are experiments that you should just watch from a safe distance.
